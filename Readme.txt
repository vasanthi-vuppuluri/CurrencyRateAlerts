Create a Currency Rate Alert System which will provide alerts to users based on the currency type and the target rate they submit to the System. Our system is referring a URL link which gets updated every 10 sec. Based on the information present on the URL, our alert system will provide alerts when Bid rate becomes equal or greater than Userâ€™s given target rate. We periodically request the XML data from the URL and parse it to provide us information about all currencies bid rates.

Language: Python
